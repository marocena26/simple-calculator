## 👾 Description 

**Welcome to Simple calculator!**

In this repository we present you a **simple, intuitive website adapted to any kind of device** (mobile, tablet and PC) so you can take a look at it at any time. **Designed and developed with HTML, CSS and JS**, with just a few clicks you can do simple mathematical operations. 

### What operations can I do?

- Operations with integers numbers.
- Operations with positive numbers.


## 📝 Requirements

The exercise consists on developing a web-site using the following **elements**:

- **JS**

The following **requirements** have to be respected:

1. A **text field** representing the **left member** of our calculation.
2. A **select field** that will **contain** a list of the following **operators** as options:("+", "-", "\*", "/", " %").
3. A **text field** representing the **right member** of our calculation.
4. A **submit** field with the value **"Try me!"**.

The mathematical operations shall be solved in the following way:

1. When we **click on the "Try me!" button**: result appears in an alert message.
6. When the **value** of the operation **results** in a **negative number**: appear the following message **"Error :("**.
7. **Division and modulo by zero**: appear the following message: **"It's over 9000!"**.

> As an extra, a **reset button** has been added to make the user experience more pleasant 🥰.
